    Registration and Account Integrity
</h1>
<p>
    As part of the registration process, you will need to accept our ToS, and also provide us with your name, your phone number, your email ID and in certain scenarios, contact information of your parents/guardian. We would not at any time request you to provide us with access to your password, unless you have given us explicit written permission to access your account pursuant to a request for assistance or support.

It is your responsibility to ensure that the information you provide is accurate, secure, and not misleading. You cannot create an account username and password using (i) the names and information of another person; or (ii) using words that are the trademarks or the property of another party (including ours); or (iii) words that are vulgar, obscene or in any other way inappropriate. You agree and confirm that you will never use another User's account nor provide access to your account to any third- party. You agree and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the activities that occur on your account, and you shall keep your account password secure and not share the same with anyone. You must notify iNeuron immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. At no point in time will iNeuron be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, and you shall solely be liable for the losses caused to iNeuron or others due to such unauthorized use, if any.

You shall be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services necessary to connect to, access, receive iNeuron Services or use the Platform, including, without limitation, hardware devices, software, and other internet, wireless, broadband, phone or other mobile communication device connection services. You shall be solely responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Platform, and you shall be responsible for all charges incurred in connection with the use of the Platform or iNeuron Services in connection with all such equipment and ancillary services.

<h1>Use of your Information and User Data</h1>
<p>
    All User Data that you create, transmit, transfer to us, submit, display or otherwise make available while using iNeuron Services, should only be information that you own or have the right to use or share (as may be applicable). If you transfer any personally identifiable information to us, we will assume that you have informed the person concerned and procured the necessary consent for such transfer, sharing, processing and/or using the information on the Platform and/or in respect of the Services. We may use the above information as per our Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable laws.

While we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the data stored on our servers is persistent and always available to our Users, we will not be responsible in the event of failure of the third-party servers or any other factors outside our reasonable control, that may cause the User Data to be permanently deleted, irretrievable, or temporarily inaccessible.
